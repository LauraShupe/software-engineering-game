# Software Engineering Game Project



## Overview

This project is a game developed as part of a Software Engineering course, focusing on iterative development and sound software design rather than gameplay complexity.



## Process & Design

The project was completed in a team-based development environment using an iterative approach. Early iterations focused on understanding system behavior and user goals, while later iterations refined the system design using modeling artifacts and refactoring to improve modularity and maintainability.



Software engineering concepts applied include:

- Domain modeling

- Use case analysis

- Object-oriented design

- Separation of concerns and modularity



## Design & Documentation

System behavior and requirements were modeled using standard software engineering artifacts, including use cases, sequence diagrams, and domain models. These artifacts were used to guide design decisions across iterations and ensure traceability between requirements and implementation.



Detailed documentation is available in the `docs/` directory.





## Implementation

The system architecture was refined across iterations to improve maintainability and clarity. Core functionality was implemented collaboratively using version control and code reviews.
