# Software Engineering Game Project


## Overview
This is a Java-based game developed using [Greenfoot](https://www.greenfoot.org/).  
The project was completed as part of a Software Engineering course, focusing on **iterative development**, **object-oriented design**, and **software engineering best practices**. The game allows players to interact with a dynamic environment, and all game logic, assets, and design artifacts are included in this repository.



## Process & Design

The project followed an **iterative software development process**:

1. **Iteration 1** – Analyzed the system as-is, created high-level use cases, and captured initial system requirements.  
2. **Iteration 2** – Refined the design, created detailed use cases, sequence diagrams, and domain models, and refactored the architecture to improve **modularity**, **maintainability**, and **scalability**.

All iterations were documented to ensure **traceability between requirements and implementation**, demonstrating an understanding of formal software engineering processes.

## Documentation

The following design artifacts are included in the `docs/` folder:

- Requirements (`docs/requirements.md`)  
- Use Case Model (`docs/use-cases.md`)  
- Sequence Diagrams (`docs/sequence-diagrams.md`)  
- Design Class Diagram (`docs/design-class-diagram.md`)  
- Traceability Matrix (`docs/traceability-matrix.md`) 

These documents provide insight into the **planning, design, and decision-making process** behind the game.

## How to Run
1. Open `project.greenfoot` in Greenfoot.  
2. Compile and run the scenario.  
3. All necessary assets are included in the `images/` and `sounds/` folders.
