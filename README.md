# Software Engineering Game Project

## Overview
This project is a game developed as part of a Software Engineering course, focusing on iterative development and sound software design rather than gameplay complexity.

## Process & Design
The project was completed in a team-based development environment using an iterative approach. Early iterations focused on understanding the problem domain and system behavior, while later iterations emphasized design improvements and refactoring.

Software engineering concepts applied include:
- Domain modeling
- Use case analysis
- Object-oriented design
- Separation of concerns and modularity

## Implementation
The system architecture was refined across iterations to improve maintainability and clarity. Core functionality was implemented collaboratively using version control and code reviews.

## Tech Stack
- Language(s): Java
- Tools: Git
- Environment: Greenfoot

## How to Run
